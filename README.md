# Dietary-Recommendation
A food recommendation engine is a technology-driven system designed to suggest or recommend food items to users based on their preferences, dietary restrictions, past behavior, or other relevant data. 
These engines leverage data analysis and machine learning algorithms to provide personalized food recommendations, making it easier for individuals to discover new dishes, restaurants, or recipes that align with their tastes.
